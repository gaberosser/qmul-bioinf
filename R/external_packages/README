This directory contains any external packages that have *not* been added to the regular R repos (CRAN or bioconductor). In these cases, it is necessary to build then install from a local tar.

1) Build from the directory. Run from a shell (not in R):
R CMD build /path/to/package_dir

2) Install from the resultant tar.gz. Run from within R:
install.packages('/path/to/package.v1.tar.gz', repos=NULL)

NB I don't think dependencies get installed automatically, d'oh!
