```{r setup, include=FALSE}
require(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath('..'))

if (!"sesame" %in% installed.packages()) {
  source("http://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
  biocLite("sesame")
}

if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("sesame")

```

The aim of this script is to load raw methylation data using the [SeSAMe](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sesame.html) `R` package. 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
